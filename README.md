# Blog-Project-Improved

I've finished the blog project finally :) This project taught me a lot of things about backend development.
I've learned:

- Creating Signup/Login/Logout page & functionality
- CRUD operations
- Authentication with JWT
- Protecting routes using custom middleware
- Conditional rendering
