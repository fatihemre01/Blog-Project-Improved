# Blog-Project-Improved

Finally I've finished the blog project :) This project taught me a lot of things about backend development.

I've learned:

- Creating Signup/Login/Logout page & functionality
- CRUD operations
- Storing and reading data in cookies
- Authentication with JWT
- Protecting routes using custom middleware
- Conditional rendering
